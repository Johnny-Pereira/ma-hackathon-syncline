# Team04 Project Overview
Our project aims to streamline the development workflow by automating the generation of commit messages using AI, specifically focusing on summarizing script changes. By leveraging the power of GPT models, we aim to create a tool that not only enhances productivity but also ensures that commit messages accurately reflect the changes made, providing more context and clarity in version control.
